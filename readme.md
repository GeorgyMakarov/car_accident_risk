## Predict risk of car accident from trip parameters

**Main question**: is it possible to predict car accident risk if you know
what you drive, when you drive and where you drive your vehicle?

**Sub-questions**:  

1. what open accident data is available from authorities?  
2. is this data sufficient to build risk prediction model?  
3. how is it possible to measure car accident risk?  
3. what model type is possible to build based on available data?  
4. how to prepare the data for model training?  
5. how is it possible to measure the accuracy of the model?



## Action plan

Week 52, 2020:  

- make dirty dataset with all car accidents for 2015 -- 2019;  
- make tidy dataset with all car accidents for 2015 -- 2019;  
- make negative cases for accidents;  
- write weekly report RMD;
